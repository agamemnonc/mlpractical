    "This tutorial is about linear transforms - a basic building block of neural networks, including deep learning models.\n",

    "# Virtual environments and syncing repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you proceed onwards, remember to activate you virtual environments so you can use the software you installed last week as well as run the notebooks in interactive mode, not through the github.com website.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Virtual environments\n",
    "\n",
    "To activate the virtual environment:\n",
    "   * If you were in last week's Tuesday or Wednesday group type `activate_mlp` or `source ~/mlpractical/venv/bin/activate`\n",
    "   * If you were in the Monday group:\n",
    "      + and if you have chosen the **comfy** way type: `workon mlpractical`\n",
    "      + and if you have chosen the **generic** way, `source` your virutal environment using `source` and specyfing the path to the activate script (you need to localise it yourself, there were not any general recommendations w.r.t dir structure and people have installed it in different places, usually somewhere in the home directories. If you cannot easily find it by yourself, use something like: `find . -iname activate` ):\n",
    "\n",
    "## On Synchronising repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter the git mlp repository you set up last week (i.e. `~/mlpractical/repo-mlp`) and once you sync the repository (in one of the two below ways), start the notebook session by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ipython notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Default way\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid potential conflicts between the changes you have made since last week and our additions, we recommend `stash` your changes and `pull` the new code from the mlpractical repository by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `git stash save \"Lab1 work\"`\n",
    "2. `git pull`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, if you need to, you can always (temporaily) restore a desired state of the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For advanced github users\n",
    "\n",
    "It is OK if you want to keep your changes and merge the new code with whatever you already have, but you need to know what you are doing and how to resolve conflicts.\n",

    "### Note on storing matrices in computer memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to store the following matrix in memory: $\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\n",
    "1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n",
    "4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n",
    "7 & 8 & 9 \\end{array} \\right]$ \n",
    "\n",
    "If you allocate the memory at once for the whole matrix, then the above matrix would be organised as a vector in one of two possible forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Row-wise layout where the order would look like: $\\left [ \\begin{array}{ccccccccc}\n",
    "1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\end{array} \\right ]$\n",
    "* Column-wise layout where the order would look like: $\\left [ \\begin{array}{ccccccccc}\n",
    "1 & 4 & 7 & 2 & 5 & 8 & 3 & 6 & 9 \\end{array} \\right ]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Although `numpy` can easily handle both formats (possibly with some computational overhead), in our code we will stick with the more modern (and default) `C`-like approach and use the row-wise format (in contrast to Fortran that used a column-wise approach). \n",
    "\n",
    "This means, that in this tutorial:\n",
    "* vectors are kept row-wise $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_1, \\ldots, x_D) $ (rather than $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_1, \\ldots, x_D)^T$)\n",
    "* similarly, in case of matrices we will stick to: $\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc}\n",
    "x_{11} & x_{12} & \\ldots & x_{1D} \\\\\n",
    "x_{21} & x_{22} & \\ldots & x_{2D} \\\\\n",
    "x_{31} & x_{32} & \\ldots & x_{3D} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]$ and each row (i.e. $\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} x_{11} & x_{12} & \\ldots & x_{1D} \\end{array} \\right]$) represents a single data-point (like one MNIST image or one window of observations)\n",
    "\n",
    "In lecture slides you will find the equations following the conventional mathematical approach, using column vectors, but you can easily map between column-major and row-major organisations using a matrix transpose.\n",

    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linear and Affine Transforms\n",
    "\n",
    "The basis of all linear models is the so called affine transform, which is a transform that implements a linear transformation and translation of the input features. The transforms we are going to use are parameterised by:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A weight matrix $\\mathbf{W} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D\\times K}$: where element $w_{ik}$ is the weight from input $x_i$ to output $y_k$\n",
    "  * A bias vector $\\mathbf{b}\\in R^{K}$ : where element $b_{k}$ is the bias for output $k$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, the bias is simply some additive term, and can be easily incorporated into an additional row in weight matrix and an additional input in the inputs which is set to $1.0$ (as in the below picture taken from the lecture slides). However, here (and in the code) we will keep them separate.\n",

    "![Making Predictions](res/singleLayerNetWts-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, for the above example of 5-dimensional input vector by $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$, weight matrix $\\mathbf{W}=\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\n",
